# Rocket Telemetry Data Analysis Tool

## Project Overview
The Rocket Telemetry Data Analysis Tool leverages Python to import, process, analyze, and visualize telemetry data from rocket launches. This tool is built to provide in-depth insights into rocket performance metrics such as altitude, velocity, and acceleration.

## Features
- **Data Importing and Inspection**: Demonstrates the capability to load and inspect telemetry data from CSV files, allowing for a quick assessment of data structure and initial insights.
- **Index Setting**: Employs time stamps as indices for streamlined time series analysis, enhancing data retrieval and manipulation efficiency.
- **Acceleration Calculation**: Features advanced data science techniques by calculating acceleration from velocity through numerical differentiation, highlighting the application of calculus in data analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses `matplotlib` to create insightful visualizations of altitude and acceleration, illustrating the dynamic performance of the rocket over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Pandas**: For robust data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for performing high-level mathematical functions essential for calculating derivatives.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating detailed and informative visual plots.
